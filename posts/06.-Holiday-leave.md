**Holiday leave and money compensation**

**for untaken rest days**

The effective duration of annual leave must be expressly provided in the individual employment contract, and it cannot be less than 20 working days, not including statutory holidays.

Rest leave must be taken in full in kind every calendar year, and only in justified cases it can be kept for the next calendar year. The untaken leave must be taken at the latest within the next 18 months starting from the following year.

The leave is taken based on a schedule established by the employer after consulting the employee. According to the regulations in force, it is recommended to schedule vacations by the end of the year for the following year.

When establishing the schedule of vacations, the employer must consider the right of each employee to benefit from at least 10 consecutive working days of vacation in a calendar year.

Cash compensation for unused vacation leave is permitted and mandatory only in case of termination of the individual employment contract.
