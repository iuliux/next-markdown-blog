By foreign citizens we refer to those who do not have the citizenship of another member state of the European Union, the european economic area or the Swiss Confederation.

It should be specified that the number of foreign citizens who can work in romania is limited, their access to the labor market in romania being regulated by the government in the form of an annual quota.

For example, the approved quota for the year 2024 is *100,000 newly admitted foreign workers*.

In order to be legally employed in Romania they must follow the following steps:

1. Finding a romanian employer who offers a vacancy that is suitable for the candidate's training and skills and obtaining from them a firm employment offer

2. Getting the work permit from the immigration office by the employer

3. Getting a long-stay visa for employment

4. Coming to Romania and apply for a temporary residence card (TRC).
