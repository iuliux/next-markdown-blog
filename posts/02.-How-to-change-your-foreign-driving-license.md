A first condition for changing your driving license with a Romanian one is to have temporary or permanent residence in Romania.

Establishing residence in Romania can be done by getting from immigration office a registration certificate for citizens of the EU, of the european economic area or of the Swiss confederation or of a temporary residence card (TRC) for other foreign citizens.

Not every foreign driving license can be exchanged for a Romanian one.

The driving licenses that can be exchanged are only those issued by the authorities of countries that are party to the road traffic convention or countries with which Romania has concluded bilateral or multilateral treaties on the mutual recognition of driving licenses.

The documents you need for changing the foreign drivering license are: - application, - the foreign driving license in original + a legalized Romanian translation of it, - the applicant's identity document proving residence or domicile in Romania, - proof of payment of the tax in the amount of 89 RON (aproximate 18 Euro), - the medical certificate only if you request a new term of validity for the driving license.
